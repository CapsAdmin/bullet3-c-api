This is a c api for bullet I use in Goluwa. I bind what I need and try to avoid callbacks (because of luajit).  But I also try to make it

Please note that I'm not very experienced with bullet, C++ or making C libraries in general. So if you see something wrong don't hesitate to make an issue or pull request.
